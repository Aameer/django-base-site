Django Base Site
================


About
-----

The Django Base Site is a skeleton base site that can be used to jumpstart any new Django site. `Brent O'Connor <http://www.epicserve.com/>`_ created it so he could use it personally to jumpstart any of his new Django projects. Please feel free to fork this project and adapt it to your own personal taste. To setup a new website just follow the setup instructions in the ``docs`` or ``docs/html`` directories.
